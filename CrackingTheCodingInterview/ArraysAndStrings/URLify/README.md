# URLify
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string 
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" 
length of the string. 

## Example
**Input:**  "Mr John Smith    ", 13  
**Output:** "Mr%20John%20Smith"
